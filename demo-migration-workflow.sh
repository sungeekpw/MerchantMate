echo "📊 Step 1: Check current migration status"
echo "tsx scripts/migration-manager.ts status"
tsx scripts/migration-manager.ts status

echo "🔍 Step 2: Validate schema consistency across environments"  
echo "tsx scripts/migration-manager.ts validate"
tsx scripts/migration-manager.ts validate

echo "📝 The proper workflow for making schema changes:"
echo ""
echo "1. Make changes to shared/schema.ts in development"
echo "2. Generate migration: tsx scripts/migration-manager.ts generate"
echo "3. Apply to development: tsx scripts/migration-manager.ts apply dev"
echo "4. Test changes thoroughly in development"
echo "5. Apply to test: tsx scripts/migration-manager.ts apply test" 
echo "6. Validate changes in test environment"
echo "7. After certification, apply to production: tsx scripts/migration-manager.ts apply prod"

echo "🚨 SAFETY FEATURES:"
echo "- Automatic backups before each migration"
echo "- Transaction safety (rollback on error)"
echo "- Version tracking per environment"
echo "- Checksum verification"
echo "- No direct production changes allowed"
