# Core CRM - Merchant Payment Processing System

## Overview
Core CRM is a comprehensive merchant payment processing management system designed to streamline merchant onboarding, transaction management, location tracking, form processing, and analytics. It offers role-based access for various user types (merchants, agents, administrators, corporate users). The project aims to provide a robust, scalable, and secure platform for payment processing businesses, empowering them with efficient, transparent, and secure payment management to gain a competitive edge. Key capabilities include enhanced field types (Percentage, SSN, Expiration Date validation), advanced PDF parsing for address and signature groups, and progressive disclosure of owner fields.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
- **Theming**: CSS variables for consistent look and feel.
- **Form Design**: React Hook Form with Zod validation.
- **Responsive Design**: Radix UI and shadcn/ui with Tailwind CSS.
- **Icon Color Coding**: Visual differentiation by user type (Agents: Blue, Merchants: Green, Prospects: Yellow).

### Technical Implementations
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript and Vite, TanStack Query, Wouter for routing.
- **Backend**: Express.js with TypeScript.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM on Neon serverless.
- **Authentication**: Session-based with `express-session`, PostgreSQL session store, and 2FA.
- **Email Service**: SendGrid for transactional emails with webhook integration, including a WYSIWYG editor (React Quill).
- **File Handling**: Multer for PDF form uploads.

### Feature Specifications
- **Company-Centric Data Architecture**: Companies as the root entity.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Granular permissions for multiple roles.
- **Secure Authentication**: Session management, 2FA, password reset, strong password requirements.
- **Merchant & Agent Management**: Comprehensive profiles, assignment, status, fee management.
- **Location Management**: Polymorphic locations with geolocation and operating hours.
- **Transaction Processing**: Tracking, commission calculations, revenue analytics.
- **Form Management System**: PDF upload/parsing (including auto-detection for address, signature, percentage, SSN, and expiration date fields), dynamic field generation, public access, conditional fields with real-time evaluation.
- **Dashboard System**: Personalized, widget-based dashboards with real-time analytics.
- **Digital Signature System**: Comprehensive signature capture and management with multi-role support, auto-detection from PDFs, canvas/typed capture methods, email workflows, status tracking, token-based security, and audit trails.
- **Address Validation & Autocomplete**: Google Maps Geocoding and Places Autocomplete integration.
- **Campaign Management**: Full CRUD for campaigns, pricing types, fee groups, equipment associations.
- **SOC2 Compliance Features**: Comprehensive audit trail, logging, security events, login attempt tracking.
- **Generic Trigger/Action Catalog System**: Extensible event-driven action system supporting multi-channel notifications and action chaining.
- **User Profile Management**: Self-service profile/settings page.

### System Design Choices
- **Testing Framework**: TDD-style with Jest and React Testing Library.
- **Schema Management**: Migration-first deployment pipeline with Drizzle's migration system for automated, deterministic, and auditable schema changes.
- **Multi-Environment Support**: Session-based database environment switching (Development, Test, Production) with a strict `Dev → Test → Production` promotion workflow.
- **Database Safety**: Strict protocols and wrapper scripts to prevent accidental production database modifications, including automatic backups and checksum validation for migrations.
- **User-Company Association Pattern**: **CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE** - All agent and merchant lookups MUST use the generic pattern: `User → user_company_associations → Company → Agent/Merchant`.

## **🚨 CRITICAL: Database Schema Change Workflow**

### **MANDATORY RULE for AI Agents:**
**AFTER EVERY CHANGE to `shared/schema.ts`, you MUST immediately generate a migration.**

### **Required Steps (Non-Negotiable):**

1. **Make Schema Change** - Edit `shared/schema.ts`
2. **IMMEDIATELY Generate Migration** - Run:
   ```bash
   tsx scripts/migration-manager.ts generate
   ```
3. **Verify Migration Created** - Check `migrations/` directory for new `.sql` file
4. **Document Change** - Update Recent Changes section in this file

### **Why This is Critical:**
- ❌ **Without migration**: Test/Production won't get schema changes
- ❌ **Schema drift**: Environments become out of sync
- ❌ **Deployment failures**: Automated sync commands will fail
- ✅ **With migration**: All environments stay synchronized

### **Migration Commands Reference:**

**For Agents Making Schema Changes:**
```bash
# After editing shared/schema.ts:
tsx scripts/migration-manager.ts generate        # Creates migration SQL file
tsx scripts/migration-manager.ts status          # Verify migration is listed
```

**For Admin Deployments:**
```bash
tsx scripts/sync-environments.ts dev-to-test     # Deploy to Test
tsx scripts/sync-environments.ts test-to-prod    # Deploy to Production
```

**For Troubleshooting:**
```bash
tsx scripts/migration-manager.ts validate        # Check for schema drift
tsx scripts/migration-manager.ts apply test      # Manually apply to Test
tsx scripts/migration-manager.ts apply prod      # Manually apply to Production
```

### **Migration System Details:**
- **Tracking Table**: `schema_migrations` in each environment
- **Migration Files**: Stored in `migrations/` directory as SQL files
- **Automatic Backups**: Created before each migration apply
- **Transactional**: Each migration runs in a transaction (atomic)
- **Checksum Validation**: Prevents file tampering
- **Environment-Specific**: Each environment tracks its own migration history
