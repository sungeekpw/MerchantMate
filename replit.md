# Core CRM - Merchant Payment Processing System

## Overview
Core CRM is a comprehensive merchant payment processing management system that streamlines merchant onboarding, transaction management, location tracking, form processing, and analytics. It's designed with role-based access for various user types, including merchants, agents, administrators, and corporate users, aiming to provide a robust, scalable, and secure platform for payment processing businesses. The business vision is to empower businesses with efficient, transparent, and secure payment management, offering a competitive edge in the market.

## Recent Changes (August 2025)
- **BACKUP CREATION SYSTEM FIXED**: Resolved backup creation failures in migration system by replacing unreliable drizzle-kit introspect with direct SQL queries to information_schema. Migration system now creates reliable schema backups before applying changes, ensuring complete safety during migrations. Backup files are stored in migrations/schema-backups/ with timestamp and environment identification.
- **DEVELOPMENT SCHEMA SYNCHRONIZED**: Successfully applied migration `0001_sync_development_schema` to bring development database up to date with production schema. Reduced column differences from 53 to 23, synchronizing 30 columns across audit_logs, equipment_items, fee_groups, locations, merchants, and transactions tables. Development now has enhanced SOC2 compliance logging, comprehensive merchant profiles, and improved inventory management. Migration applied through bulletproof workflow ensuring transaction safety and proper version control.
- **UNSAFE SCHEMA SYNC REMOVED FROM UI**: Removed dangerous schema synchronization functionality from Testing Utilities interface while preserving schema comparison for visual identification. Changed "Compare & Sync Schemas" button to "Compare Schemas" and removed all sync configuration controls, execution buttons, and related UI components. The interface now safely displays schema differences across environments and directs users to use the bulletproof migration workflow. This prevents accidental unsafe operations while maintaining visibility into schema differences for development and debugging purposes.
- **BULLETPROOF MIGRATION WORKFLOW IMPLEMENTED**: Completely replaced unsafe direct schema synchronization with a bulletproof version-controlled migration system. The new system enforces proper development → test → production workflow with automatic backup creation, transaction safety, and rollback capability. Created comprehensive migration manager (`scripts/migration-manager.ts`) with commands for generating migrations, applying to specific environments, and validating consistency. Added migration tracking table for each environment with checksum verification. Deprecated old `scripts/sync-database-schemas.ts` and `/api/admin/schema-sync` endpoints with proper warnings. New API endpoint `/api/admin/migration` provides secure migration management. All schema changes now require proper versioning and cannot be applied directly to production without test validation. Documentation in `MIGRATION_WORKFLOW.md` provides complete workflow guide. This addresses critical production safety concerns and ensures proper change management.
- **Complete Email System Implementation**: Successfully implemented and seeded the complete email management system for Core CRM. Created email_templates, email_activity, and email_triggers tables with proper relationships and indexes. Seeded 11 professional email templates, 8 automated email triggers, and sample activity data. All email-related API endpoints (email-templates, email-activity, email-triggers, email-stats) are now functional and returning proper data. Added comprehensive seeding script `scripts/seed-email-system.ts` for full email system deployment. Resolved all 500 errors related to missing email tables and established complete email workflow infrastructure.
- **CRITICAL FIX: Complete Database Environment Isolation**: Resolved critical security vulnerability where fee group creation was bypassing database environment middleware, causing development data to be written to production database. Added dbEnvironmentMiddleware to ALL fee-related endpoints (fee-groups, fee-items, fee-item-groups) ensuring complete database isolation. Fixed duplicate API endpoints and verified proper environment routing with console logging. All fee management operations now correctly respect the login screen environment selector.
- **Fee Management System Complete**: Implemented complete fee group edit functionality and fee item creation with proper UI dialogs, backend API endpoints, and database integration. Resolved persistent 500 server errors during agent creation. The system maintains strict database environment isolation based on login screen selection, with session-based persistence and ACID compliance across all authenticated routes.
- **UI Cache Optimization**: Fixed frontend cache issues that prevented real-time display of database updates. Implemented proper cache invalidation with staleTime: 0 and gcTime: 0 for fee-related queries, ensuring UI immediately reflects database changes without manual refresh. Fee item group associations now display correctly in real-time.
- **Fee Items API Enhancement**: Fixed fee items API endpoint to include complete fee group information in response. Modified /api/fee-items route to join with fee_groups table, ensuring UI displays fee group names instead of placeholder values. Fee items grid now shows proper fee group associations.
- **Edit Fee Item Functionality Complete**: Implemented missing edit fee item feature with complete CRUD functionality. Added edit dialog, form validation, onClick handlers, and PUT endpoint for updates. All fee item operations now support full lifecycle management with proper database environment isolation and real-time UI updates.
